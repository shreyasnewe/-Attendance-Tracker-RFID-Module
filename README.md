- Password stored on RFID card (Block 16)

- LCD Display (16x2) via I2C for instructions and feedback

- Servo Motor to control physical locking/unlocking

- Built with Arduino Uno R3 and MFRC522 RFID module

- Compact and easy-to-use design

# Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3

- MFRC522 RFID Module

- 16x2 LCD Display with I2C

- Servo Motor SG90

- Breadboard & Jumper wires

- RFID Tag/Card (MIFARE Classic 1K)

## 🔌 Hardware Configuration

This project uses an Arduino Uno R3 with an RFID module (MFRC522), a 16x2 LCD with I2C, and an SG90 servo motor. Below are the wiring details:


### 📘 MFRC522 RFID Module

| RFID Pin     | Arduino Pin |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **SDA (SS)** | D10         |
| **SCK**      | D13         |
| **MOSI**     | D11         |
| **MISO**     | D12         |
| **RST**      | D9          |
| **GND**      | GND         |
| **3.3V**     | 3.3V        |

> ⚠️ **Note:** The MFRC522 module must be powered with **3.3V** — connecting it to 5V may damage it.


### 📗 16x2 LCD with I2C

| LCD Pin | Arduino Pin |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **GND** | GND         |
| **VCC** | 5V          |
| **SDA** | A4          |
| **SCL** | A5          |

> 💡 The default I2C address is usually **`0x27`**. If your LCD does not display anything, try address `0x3F`.


### 📙 SG90 Servo Motor

| Servo Wire                 | Arduino Pin |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Signal** (Orange/Yellow) | D3          |
| **VCC** (Red)              | 5V          |
| **GND** (Brown/Black)      | GND         |

> ⚠️ **Important:** The servo can draw a lot of power. If your Arduino resets or LCD flickers:
>
> * Add a **1000μF capacitor** between 5V and GND.
> * Or use a **separate 5V power source** for the servo, with common GND.

| **RFID (MFRC522)** | D10 (SDA), D9 (RST), D11 (MOSI), D12 (MISO), D13 (SCK) |
| **LCD (I2C)**      | A4 (SDA), A5 (SCL)                                     |
| **Servo Motor**    | D3                                                     |


# How it Works
When powered on, the LCD displays: Mark your attendance or Scan your card.

Upon scanning, the system reads the UID and checks if it's authorized.

It then reads Block 16 of the card and compares the stored password (e.g., Security).

If both UID and password match:

Access is granted

Servo motor rotates to unlock

If verification fails, access is denied.

# Folder Structure
/code/               → Arduino .ino file(s)  
/circuit-diagram/    → Wiring diagram (image or PDF)  
/presentation/       → Project presentation (PPTX or PDF)  

# Setup Instructions
1. Wire your components as shown in the circuit diagram.

2. Upload the code from /code/ to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

3. Make sure the RFID card has the password stored in Block 16.

4. Test by scanning the RFID card.

# Prerequisites
Before running the main project, you need to prepare your RFID card by writing a password and updating the access key.

1. Write Password to Block 19
  You must write the password "Security" into Block 19 of your RFID card. You can do this using the write_password_and_key.ino sketch provided in this repository.

2. Set Custom Key A for Block 19
  The system uses a custom key (A1 B2 C3 D4 E5 F6) to read Block 19. Make sure you:

  Upload the write_password_and_key.ino sketch to your Arduino.

  Scan your card once.

  It will:
  
  Write "Security" to Block 19.

  Change Key A for Block 19 to A1 B2 C3 D4 E5 F6.

- Note: After this step, you cannot read Block 19 using the default key (FF FF FF FF FF FF). Only your Arduino code with the custom key can access it.

3. Confirm Card Using NFC App (Optional)
  Use an app like NFC Tools (Android) to verify the card contents if needed:

  You should see "Security" in Block 19 (if your phone supports MIFARE Classic).
  
# Troubleshooting

- If the system doesn't respond to your RFID card, try scanning the card using an **NFC reader app** on your smartphone (e.g., “NFC Tools” on Android) to verify:
  - UID is readable
  - Data is stored correctly in Block 19

- Make sure you've written the **correct password** (`Security`) in **Block 19** of your RFID card.

- The code uses a **custom key (`A1 B2 C3 D4 E5 F6`)** to access Block 19. You must ensure this key is written to that block.

- Double-check that you're powering the **RFID module with 3.3V**, not 5V.

- If using a clone MFRC522 module and facing inconsistent readings, try another power source or reduce wire length.

# Future Improvements
Add Bluetooth/Cloud logging of entries

Admin card or button to add new UIDs

OLED Display instead of LCD

Buzzer and LED indicators
